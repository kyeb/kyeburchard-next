the pierogis meander about, peacefully â€” like a grazing flock of sheep. at the
touch of a button, a fork appears and begins to chase. the pierogis scatter
instantly. they fear for their lives. with another touch, you _become_ the
pierogi. you see through her eyes, smell through her nostrils, feel the terror
as you are chased.

originally a project for 6.837 at MIT. check out the
