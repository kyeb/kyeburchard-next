Overcooked: Food-programmable Gate Array is an online multiplayer, FPGA-based
game heavily inspired by the popular collaborative cooking game Overcooked. The
game consists of ~150 lines of Python for the server, ~250 lines of C++ for the
ESP32 communications bridge, and ~3,500 lines of SystemVerilog.
