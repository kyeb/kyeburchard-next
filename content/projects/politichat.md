a queue-style video chat platform where constituents can virtually line up to
speak with a candidate, allowing candidates to have personal, virtual
conversations that support their campaigns. we fill the technology gap between
large, impersonal livestreamed virtual rallies and low-throughput, high-impact
individual conversations.

check out our homepage [here](https://politi.chat/). originally a project for
cs91r at harvard.
