# kyeburchard

My personal website. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) for ultra-fast static site generation with zero JavaScript runtime by default.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

Output goes to `dist/`.

## Previous iterations

- [Next.js version](https://github.com/kyeb/kyeburchard-next) (main branch, pre-Astro migration)
- [Static HTML/SCSS version](https://github.com/kyeb/kyeburchard)
